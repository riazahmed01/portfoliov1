# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio page version one. This is my first attempt at it and I will work on this more in the future so the code is cleaner and more readable. I used only HTML and CSS for this. In my next version I hope to incorporate what I learn about JavaScript, Node and React.

Pages compleated:
- [x] Home Page
- [x] Education
- [x] Projects
- [x] Contact
